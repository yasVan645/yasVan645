I'm a software and web developer who is passionate about new tech discoveries and creating technology to elevate and help people in their particular needs, and constructing a tech enthusiast community. My technology developing areas are mostly based around Javascript, APIs + Markups (HTML+CSS) and GraphQL for some of the time. I'm also still exploring new and upcoming JS frameworks and open to learning new stuff.
